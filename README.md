Population Data Visualization – Task 1
This project visualizes the World Bank Total Population Dataset using Python in Google Colab. The dataset (provided as a ZIP file) is uploaded, extracted, and processed to understand global population trends.

Technologies Used
Python
Google Colab
pandas – data loading & cleaning
zipfile / io – extracting CSV from ZIP
matplotlib – data visualization

What the Notebook Does
Uploads and extracts the dataset
Loads population data into a DataFrame
Cleans and selects the latest population values

Creates:
Histogram of global population distribution
Bar Chart of top 10 most populated countries

Objective
To perform basic data analysis and visualization using real-world population data, improving understanding of EDA, dataset handling, and plotting techniques.

Outcome
The project helps in gaining hands-on experience with:
Reading ZIP datasets
Processing population data
Building simple visualizations
Understanding population trends across countries
